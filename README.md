# Tetris game in Python

A personal project which consists in coding a simple version of the Tetris game using Python.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the library __Numpy__ as well as the library __Pygame__ to render the figure. To make the project work, one can open a virtual environment. For example, for a Linux user :

```python3 -m venv tetris_env```

Then :

```source tetris_env/bin/activate```

After this, one can install the requires librairies using ```pip``` :

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running the game

Running the project can be done using the following command (from the root of the project), it should open a window displaying the game :

```python3 scripts/main.py```

And there you go !
